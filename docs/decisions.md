# Research decisions

## 2026-10-16 — Initial scope

| Decision | Reason and consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Focused research report | A useful first deliverable within three weeks plus a short review buffer; publication quality depends on evidence |
| V-JEPA 2 ViT-L first | Released encoder/predictor; avoids the smaller V-JEPA 2.1 distillation mismatch risk |
| Fixed target encoder | Stable loss reference across checkpoints; conclusions exclude the original moving-target protocol |
| One small video dataset | Preserve budget for repeated training and strong evaluation |
| Three fine-tuning seeds | Expose variation; data split is shared across seeds |
| Up to $200 total | Use university/local resources first and measure rental feasibility |
| 10-20 human hours weekly | Reserve human review for access, unexpected results, and scientific interpretation |

These choices were confirmed in the research planning discussion. UCF101,
the 20/5/5 per-class subset, and numerical training defaults are the proposed
implementation of that scope, subject to the documented feasibility gate.

## 2026-10-16 — Repository setup

Keep the previous project's root `models/`, `scripts/`, `notes/`, `report/`,
`goals.md`, `progress.md`, and `setup_lambda_labs.md`. Add configurations,
protocol documentation, split manifests, and lightweight GitHub checks.
Continue the previous repository's MIT license for original code.

No previous experimental results, model code, collaborator list, or private
conversation exports are copied into this project. Only the organization
and useful documentation conventions are carried over.

## Decisions still requiring pilot evidence

- Exact upstream commit and checkpoint hash/keys/shapes.
- Deterministic temporal sampling, resizing, decoding, and short-clip policy.
- GPU microbatch, accumulation, precision, and optimizer implementation details.
- Evaluation step sizes, fixed subsets, attack/scoring mask banks, and probes.
- Measured end-to-end cost and whether 20 or 10 training videos per class fit.

Resolve these before locking the protocol, without using final test outcomes.
