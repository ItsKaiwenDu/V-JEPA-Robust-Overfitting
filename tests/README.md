# Scientific acceptance tests

There are no model or training tests yet because those components are not
implemented. The GitHub workflow currently checks only the scaffold and
Python syntax. Add meaningful tests alongside the corresponding research
implementation, including:

- Pixel-space perturbation bounds, clipping, and zero-epsilon equivalence.
- Finite, nonzero input gradients and a small FP32 finite-difference check.
- Frozen target weights, clean target inputs, and correct detached features.
- Correct context/target token alignment and independent mask evaluation.
- Agreement with the upstream clean native loss on the same batch and masks.
- Dataset source-group separation, manifest replay, and cache invalidation.
- Parameter updates restricted to context encoder and predictor.
- Checkpoint resume preserving optimizer, scheduler, scaler, and RNG state.
- Stronger-attack/restart checks and per-example candidate selection.

Use small fixtures for correctness tests; do not require a full dataset or
large checkpoint in ordinary CI. GPU integration checks should be explicit,
with provenance and measured runtime. Do not label skipped scientific tests
as evidence of a validated pipeline.
